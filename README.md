# mem-store

MemStore is an in-memory database engine equipped with a user-friendly Command-Line Interface (CLI) designed to facilitate efficient data storage and manipulation. This versatile database system accommodates three essential data types: integers, strings, and lists, allowing users to seamlessly interact with their data. In the MemStore data is stored with a unique key, allowing users to store information conveniently and retrieve it using these keys. Through intuitive commands such as SET, GET, NSET, NGET, LSET, LGET, RPUSH, LPUSH, LREMOVE, and RREMOVE, MemStore empowers users to store, retrieve, and manage their data with ease. The CLI interface offers a straightforward means of communication, ensuring that users can effortlessly enter commands and receive immediate feedback.  

 

Although MemStore may not be as advanced as some established databases like Redis, it serves as a useful educational tool and demonstrates the implementation of core database functionalities. With its focus on lightweight, in-memory data management, MemStore proves to be a practical solution for various software development and data manipulation scenarios. 

 

Overall, the in-memory database engine project aims to provide a simple yet practical solution for users to interact with and manipulate data using a command-line interface, making it a valuable addition to various software development and data management scenarios.
